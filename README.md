-----/ Clima - A flutter based weather application /-----


A weather application that fetches the the weather of the current location with the help of the Openweather API.

This App helped me learn the fundamentals of API integration into Flutter Apps and also about the HTTP package like how to make a get or fetch request, etc.

The app is integrated with a dedicated search screen with the help of which one can search a particular city and fetch the corresponding city's location.
